# Benchmarks

## Setup

- **Hardware.** One exclusive node: 2 x Intel Xeon Gold 6248R, 48 cores,
  192 GB RAM, from the `parallel` partition.
- **Threads.** 48 for every program (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=MKL_NUM_THREADS=48`).
- **Calculations.** All-electron, no point-group symmetry (C1), cc-pVTZ.
- **What is timed.** Wall time per CC iteration, excluding integral
  generation and transformation. For CFOUR, the per-iteration lines of
  `xncc` / `xecc`, or the `xvcc` time divided by the number of iterations.
- **zccsdt.** `bench/profile_iter.py`, launched through
  `bench/slurm_profile.sh`. Uses the MKL build of the C kernels and
  `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE`. Every number is the mean of iterations 1-3.
  Run-to-run variation between nodes is about 20%.
- **CFOUR.** cfour-x2cso build: ifort with ILP64 threaded MKL.
  `bench/cfour/slurm_cfour.sh`, 6 iterations.
- **Measured GEMM peak** of one node (large square matrices): about
  2.4 TFLOPS (DGEMM, OpenBLAS), about 2.4-2.8 TFLOPS (ZGEMM, MKL).

Orbital counts: H2O/cc-pVTZ has 116 spin orbitals (o = 10, v = 106);
N2/cc-pVTZ has 120 (o = 14, v = 106).

## CCSDT iteration time

| Program (representation) | H2O/cc-pVTZ | N2/cc-pVTZ | H2O/cc-pVQZ |
|---|---|---|---|
| CFOUR `ncc`, REF=RHF (spin-adapted) | 0.60 s | 1.78 s | 11.7 s |
| CFOUR `ecc`, REF=RHF | 6.8 s | 19.8 s | -- |
| CFOUR `ecc`, REF=UHF (spin-integrated) | 18.7 s | 57 s | 173 s |
| CFOUR `vcc`, REF=UHF (spin-integrated) | 16 s | 56 s | -- |
| **zccsdt, real spin-orbital** | **3.2-3.6 s** | **6.7 s** | **34.6 s** |
| **zccsdt, complex spinor (X2C)** | **6.6 s** | **13.7-16.9 s** | **100.9 s** |

H2O/cc-pVQZ has 230 spin orbitals (o = 10, v = 220). It is run with
block-wise integrals and packed-only vvvv (`ZC_PACKED=1`). Peak memory is
36.5 GB (real) and 59.6 GB (complex); integral generation takes about
3 minutes and is not included.

Peak memory of zccsdt: H2O 6.2 GB (real) and 17.8 GB (complex); N2 8.3 GB
(real) and 20.3 GB (complex).

### Representation factor: theoretical vs measured

zccsdt works with spin orbitals and uses no spin symmetry, because spinors
have none. `bench/flop_counts.py` counts the minimal FMA of the two
dominant terms (pp ladder o^3 v^5, ring o^4 v^4) in three representations:

- **spin-orbital:** what zccsdt does.
- **Sz-blocked:** only Ms-conserving blocks, as in a spin-integrated UHF
  code (`ecc`/`vcc` with REF=UHF).
- **ncc model:** CFOUR `ncc` (RHF, spin-adapted), counted from its source
  code:
  - T3 is stored as i<=j<=k blocks (not all equal), each a full abc cube.
  - The pp ladder is 3 GEMMs of v^2 x v^2 x v per block (the MAGIC_CYCLE
    states with constraints 1, 4 and 7).
  - The ring terms are 9 (wmaei) plus 13-26 (wmaie) contractions of o v^4
    per block. Part of the wmaie work is skipped by an index-order test,
    hence the range.

Here o and v are spatial orbitals. Cost ratios (zccsdt / other):

| System | spin-orbital / Sz-blocked | spin-orbital / ncc (theory) | zccsdt / ncc (measured wall time) |
|---|---|---|---|
| H2O/cc-pVTZ | 7.5 | 8.5-10.6 | 5.3-6.0 |
| N2/cc-pVTZ | 7.6 | 9.4-12.1 | 3.8 |
| H2O/cc-pVQZ | 7.5 | 9.3-10.6 | 3.0 |

Asymptotically (large o) the ladder ratio spin-orbital / ncc approaches
256/12, about 21.

Achieved rate on the dominant terms (FMA x 2 / iteration time):

| System | ncc | zccsdt (real) |
|---|---|---|
| H2O/cc-pVTZ | 0.21-0.26 TFLOPS | 0.38-0.42 TFLOPS |
| N2/cc-pVTZ | 0.21-0.28 TFLOPS | 0.69 TFLOPS |
| H2O/cc-pVQZ | 0.33-0.38 TFLOPS | 1.19 TFLOPS |

Conclusions:

- **The measured slowdown against ncc (3-6x) is 2-3.5 times smaller than
  the arithmetic ratio (9-12x).** Per unit of work, zccsdt is 2-3.5 times
  more efficient than ncc at these sizes, and the advantage grows with the
  basis.
- **Against the spin-integrated codes** (`ecc`/`vcc`, REF=UHF), zccsdt is
  5-8 times faster in wall time, despite doing about 7.5 times more
  arithmetic.
- **The remaining gap to ncc is the price of the spin-orbital
  representation.** For nonrelativistic closed shells an RHF spin-adapted
  code will always win; for spinors (the target of zccsdt) there is no
  such reduction, and CFOUR has no spinor CCSDT.
- **Complex spinor iterations** cost about 2.5-3 times the real ones for 4
  times the arithmetic.

## Where the time goes (N2/cc-pVTZ, complex)

Per-iteration breakdown from the timers in `ccsdt_opt` and the C kernels
(node c054, 16.9 s per iteration in total):

| Step | Time | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| pass 2: ring + drive (C) | 6.2 s | ring GEMM 4.4 s (about 2.0 TFLOPS), antisymmetrizing reduction 0.8 s, gather 0.35 s, drive GEMM about 0.5 s |
| pp ladder (C) | 3.9 s | GEMM about 2.8 TFLOPS |
| pass 1: T3 -> T1/T2, W (C) | 2.4 s | GEMM 1.6 s |
| other intermediates (Python + MKL) | 1.5 s | packed W_vvvo 1.0 s |
| T1 dressing (Python + MKL) | 1.3 s | packed vvvv dressing 0.5 s |
| CCSD part, T1-dressed (Python + MKL) | 0.6 s | |
| DIIS (OpenMP) | 0.3 s | |

The T3 kernels (12.5 s) run their GEMMs at 2-2.8 TFLOPS. The Python-side
remainder is about 3.7 s.
